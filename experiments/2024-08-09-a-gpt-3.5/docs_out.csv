doc0001,https://science.nasa.gov/mission/lucy/,"Lucy is the first space mission to explore a diverse population of small bodies known as the Jupiter Trojan asteroids. These remnants of our early solar system are trapped on stable orbits associated with - but not close to - the giant planet Jupiter. Trojan asteroids orbit in two ""swarms"" that lead and follow Jupiter in its orbit around the Sun and are thought to be comparable in number to the objects in the main asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.

Over its 12-year mission, Lucy will explore a record-breaking number of asteroids: it will fly by two (plus a newly discovered satellite) in the belt of asteroids that circle the Sun between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, and then eight Trojans, which includes five asteroid targets and the satellites of three of those. Lucy also will fly by Earth three times to get a push from its gravity, making it the first spacecraft to return to the vicinity of Earth from the outer solar system.",gpt-3.5,"1.

This mission, named after the famous fossilized skeleton ""Lucy,"" aims to uncover important insights into the early history of our solar system.

The Trojan asteroids are divided into two groups, leading and trailing, that orbit ahead of and behind Jupiter as it travels around the Sun. Lucy's mission is set to last for an impressive 12 years, during which it will travel over 4 billion miles.

One of the key highlights of the Lucy mission is its plan to visit a total of eight Trojan asteroids, comprising five main asteroids and three smaller satellites. This ambitious endeavor will provide scientists with invaluable data to better understand the formation and evolution of our solar system.

Upon completing its mission, Lucy will become the first spacecraft to return to Earth's vicinity from the outer solar system, marking a significant milestone in space exploration. NASA scientists and researchers are eagerly anticipating the wealth of knowledge that Lucy will bring back to Earth, shedding light on the mysteries of our cosmic neighborhood.","1.
