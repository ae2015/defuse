Struggling Japanese car maker Mitsubishi Motors has struck a deal to supply French car maker Peugeot with 30,000 sports utility vehicles (SUV).

The two firms signed a Memorandum of Understanding, and say they expect to seal a final agreement by Spring 2005. The alliance comes as a badly-needed boost for loss-making Mitsubishi, after several profit warnings and poor sales. The SUVs will be built in Japan using Peugeot's diesel engines and sold mainly in the European market. Falling sales have left Mitsubishi Motors with underused capacity, and the production deal with Peugeot gives it a chance to utilise some of it.

In January, Mitsubishi Motors issued its third profits warning in nine months, and cut its sales forecasts for the year to March 2005. Its sales have slid 41% in the past year, catalysed by the revelation that the company had systematically been hiding records of faults and then secretly repairing vehicles. As a result, the Japanese car maker has sought a series of financial bailouts. Last month it said it was looking for a further 540bn yen ($5.2bn; 2.77bn pounds) in fresh financial backing, half of it from other companies in the Mitsubishi group. US-German carmaker DaimlerChrylser, a 30% shareholder in Mitsubishi Motors, decided in April 2004 not to pump in any more money. The deal with Peugeot was celebrated by Mitsubishi's newly-appointed chief executive Takashi Nishioka, who took over after three top bosses stood down last month to shoulder responsibility for the firm's troubles. Mitsubishi Motors has forecast a net loss of 472bn yen in its current financial year to March 2005. Last month, it signed a production agreement with Japanese rival Nissan Motor to supply it with 36,000 small cars for sale in Japan. It has been making cars for Nissan since 2003.",gpt-3.5,"Alright, children, let me tell you a story about two friends, Mitsubishi and Peugeot. Mitsubishi was feeling a bit sad because not many people were buying their cars, and they were losing money. But then, along came their friend Peugeot, who wanted to help them.

Peugeot made a deal with Mitsubishi to buy 30,000 special cars called sports utility vehicles, or SUVs, that Mitsubishi will build in Japan. These cars will have special engines made by Peugeot and will be sold in Europe. This was like a big high-five for Mitsubishi because it meant they could use their factories more and hopefully make more money.

You see, Mitsubishi had some problems before because they were not selling enough cars and they had some secrets about fixing their cars that they didn't tell anyone. But now, with the help of Peugeot, they are trying to get better and stronger.

Mitsubishi also has another friend named Nissan, and they made a deal to sell 36,000 small cars to Nissan to be sold in Japan. This is like sharing toys with your friends to help each other out.

So, the story of Mitsubishi and Peugeot teaches us that it's important to help each other when we are in trouble. Just like how we help our friends when they are sad or need help, Mitsubishi and Peugeot are helping each other to make better cars and be happy. And that's a wonderful thing to do, isn't it?"

The US economy added 337,000 jobs in October - a seven-month high and far more than Wall Street expectations.

In a welcome economic boost for newly re-elected President George W Bush, the Labor Department figures come after a slow summer of weak jobs gains. Jobs were created in every sector of the US economy except manufacturing. While the separate unemployment rate went up to 5.5% from 5.4% in September, this was because more people were now actively seeking work.

The 337,000 new jobs added to US payrolls in October was twice the 169,000 figure that Wall Street economists had forecast. In addition, the Labor Department revised up the number of jobs created in the two previous months - to 139,000 in September instead of 96,000, and to 198,000 in August instead of 128,000. The better than expected jobs data had an immediate upward effect on stocks in New York, with the main Dow Jones index gaining 45.4 points to 10,360 by late morning trading. ""It looks like the job situation is improving and that this will support consumer spending going into the holidays, and offset some of the drag caused by high oil prices this year,"" said economist Gary Thayer of AG Edwards & Sons.

Other analysts said the upbeat jobs data made it more likely that the US Federal Reserve would increase interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 2% when it meets next week. ""It should empower the Fed to clearly do something,"" said Robert MacIntosh, chief economist with Eaton Vance Management in Boston. Kathleen Utgoff, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor, said many of the 71,000 new construction jobs added in October were involved in rebuilding and clean-up work in Florida, and neighbouring Deep South states, following four hurricanes in August and September. The dollar rose temporarily on the job creation news before falling back to a new record low against the euro, as investors returned their attention to other economic factors, such as the US's record trade deficit. There is also speculation that President Bush will deliberately try to keep the dollar low in order to assist a growth in exports.",gpt-3.5,"Alright, boys and girls, today we have a very interesting story about our friends in a faraway land called the United States. In this land, there are many people who work hard to do different jobs, like building houses, selling things in stores, and helping others.

Now, something very exciting happened in the United States recently. They found out that more people got new jobs in the month of October! Can you believe that? It's like when you're playing a game and you find more candies than you expected - it's a great surprise!

The leaders in the United States were very happy about this good news. They said that even though some people were still looking for jobs, many more people were finding work. This made everyone feel hopeful and happy, like when you find your favorite toy that you thought was lost.

Because of all these new jobs, people in the United States were feeling more confident about spending money, especially as the holidays were approaching. It's like when you have enough candies to share with your friends at a party - everyone feels excited and happy!

The leaders also talked about some grown-up things, like interest rates and the value of money, but what's most important is that everyone was working together to make things better for everyone in the United States.

So, boys and girls, the story today is about how everyone in the United States worked hard to create more jobs and help each other. It shows that when we all work together and help one another, good things can happen for everyone. Let's remember to be kind and helpful to each other, just like our friends in the United States!"

The world's biggest confectionery firm, Cadbury Schweppes, has reported a modest rise in profits after the weak dollar took a bite out of its results.

Underlying pre-tax profits rose 1% to 933m pounds ($1.78bn) in 2004, but would have been 8% higher if currency movements were stripped out. The owner of brands such as Dairy Milk, Dr Pepper and Snapple generates more than 80% of its sales outside the UK. Cadbury said it was confident it would hit its targets for 2005. ""While the external commercial environment remains competitive, we are confident that we have the strategy, brands and people to deliver within our goal ranges in 2005,"" said chief executive Todd Stitzer.

The modest profit rise had been expected by analysts after the company said in December that the poor summer weather had hit soft drink sales in Europe.

Cadbury said its underlying sales were up by 4% in 2004. Growth was helped by its confectionery brands - including Cadbury, Trident and Halls - which enjoyed a ""successful"" year, with like-for-like sales up 6%. Drinks sales were up 2% with strong growth in US carbonated soft drinks, led by Dr Pepper and diet drinks, offset by the weaker sales in Europe. Cadbury added that its Fuel for Growth cost-cutting programme had saved 75m pounds in 2004, bringing total cost savings to 100m pounds since the scheme began in mid-2003. The programme is set to close 20% of the group's factories and shed 10% of the workforce. Cadbury Schweppes employs more than 50,000 people worldwide, with about 7,000 in the UK.",gpt-3.5,"Alright, my little friends, let me tell you a story about a magical place where they make delicious candies and drinks like chocolate, soda, and juices. This place is called Cadbury Schweppes. Now, Cadbury Schweppes had a little bit of a problem with its money because of something called a weak dollar. This weak dollar made it a bit harder for Cadbury Schweppes to make as much money as they wanted.

Even though Cadbury Schweppes still made some money, it wasn't as much as they hoped for because of the weak dollar. They have special candies like Dairy Milk and yummy drinks like Dr Pepper and Snapple that people all around the world love to buy. But because of the weak dollar, it was a bit challenging for them to make as much money as they wanted to.

But don't worry, my little friends, the people at Cadbury Schweppes are really smart and have good plans to make things better. They are working hard to make their candies and drinks even more popular so that they can make more money in the future. They are also being careful with their money and trying to save as much as they can by cutting costs. This way, they can continue making their delicious treats for all of us to enjoy.

So, my dear children, even when things are a bit tough like the weak dollar, we can still be hopeful and work hard like the people at Cadbury Schweppes to overcome challenges and keep moving forward.

US supermarket group Winn-Dixie has filed for bankruptcy protection after succumbing to stiff competition in a market dominated by Wal-Mart.

Winn-Dixie, once among the most profitable of US grocers, said Chapter 11 protection would enable it to successfully restructure. It said its 920 stores would remain open, but analysts said it would most likely off-load a number of sites. The Jacksonville, Florida-based firm has total debts of $1.87bn (980m pounds). In its bankruptcy petition it listed its biggest creditor as US foods giant Kraft Foods, which it owes $15.1m.

Analysts say Winn-Dixie had not kept up with consumers' demands and had also been burdened by a number of stores in need of upgrading. A 10-month restructuring plan was deemed a failure, and following a larger-than-expected quarterly loss earlier this month, Winn-Dixie's slide into bankruptcy was widely expected. The company's new chief executive Peter Lynch said Winn-Dixie would use the Chapter 11 breathing space to take the necessary action to turn itself around. ""This includes achieving significant cost reductions, improving the merchandising and customer service in all locations and generating a sense of excitement in the stores,"" he said. Yet Evan Mann, a senior bond analyst at Gimme Credit, said Mr Lynch's job would not be easy, as the bankruptcy would inevitably put off some customers. ""The real big issue is what's going to happen over the next one or two quarters now that they are in bankruptcy and all their customers see this in their local newspapers,"" he said.",gpt-3.5,"Alright, children, let me tell you a story about a supermarket called Winn-Dixie. Winn-Dixie is like a big store where people go to buy their groceries and things they need for their homes. But one day, Winn-Dixie faced some problems because there was another very big store called Wal-Mart that was very popular and a lot of people liked to shop there.

Because of this, Winn-Dixie had some trouble keeping up with what the people wanted to buy, and some of their stores needed to be fixed and made better. They also owed a lot of money to a company that makes food. So, Winn-Dixie decided to ask for help and protection by using something called Chapter 11. This is like when you ask your teacher or a grown-up for help when things are hard.

The boss of Winn-Dixie, Peter Lynch, said they would try very hard to make things better by making the store nicer, reducing costs, and making sure that everyone who comes to the store feels happy and excited. But some people were worried that because Winn-Dixie asked for help, some customers might not want to come to the store anymore.

So, Winn-Dixie is going to work very hard to fix everything and make sure people still like to come and shop there. It's like when you have a problem with your toy and you try to fix it so you can play with it again. Winn-Dixie is doing the same thing, but with their store.

The decision to keep interest rates on hold at 4.75% earlier this month was passed 8-1 by the Bank of England's rate-setting body, minutes have shown.

One member of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) - Paul Tucker - voted to raise rates to 5%. The news surprised some analysts who had expected the latest minutes to show another unanimous decision. Worries over growth rates and consumer spending were behind the decision to freeze rates, the minutes showed. The Bank's latest inflation report, released last week, had noted that the main reason inflation might fall was weaker consumer spending.

However, MPC member Paul Tucker voted for a quarter point rise in interest rates to 5%. He argued that economic growth was picking up, and that the equity, credit and housing markets had been stronger than expected.

The Bank's minutes said that risks to the inflation forecast were ""sufficiently to the downside"" to keep rates on hold at its latest meeting. However, the minutes added: ""Some members noted that an increase might be warranted in due course if the economy evolved in line with the central projection"". Ross Walker, UK economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, said he was surprised that a dissenting vote had been made so soon. He said the minutes appeared to be ""trying to get the market to focus on the possibility of a rise in rates"". ""If the economy pans out as they expect then they are probably going to have to hike rates."" However, he added, any rate increase is not likely to happen until later this year, with MPC members likely to look for a more sustainable pick up in consumer spending before acting.",gpt-3.5,"Alright, my dear kindergarten friends, let me tell you a story about a group of friends called the Bank of England's rate-setting body. They had a very important meeting where they needed to make a decision about something called interest rates.

Now, imagine that interest rates are like the speed of a train. Sometimes, if the train goes too fast, it can cause problems, and if it goes too slow, it might not reach its destination on time. So, these friends had to decide if they should keep the train's speed the same or make it a little faster.

During their meeting, most of the friends agreed to keep the train's speed the same, except for one friend named Paul Tucker. Paul Tucker thought it would be better to make the train go a little faster to 5%. This surprised the other friends because they all thought it was best to keep it steady at 4.75%.

They were worried about how fast the train was going because they noticed that not many people were buying things, like toys and cookies. They also saw that some parts of the train, like the wheels and the seats, were getting stronger and stronger, which was a good sign.

In the end, the friends decided to keep the train's speed the same because they were concerned about some possible problems that could happen if they made it go faster. But they did say that maybe in the future, they might need to make the train go a bit faster if everything goes well.

So, my little friends, this story teaches us that sometimes it's important to make decisions together, even if we don't all agree. And just like the friends in the story, we need to think about what's best for everyone and for the train to reach its destination safely."

The New York music studio where John Lennon spent his final hours is to close next month.

The Hit Factory, which opened 37 years ago, has played host to some of the biggest stars in music, including Paul Simon, Madonna and David Bowie.

The studio was founded by Jerry Ragovoy in 1968. In 1975 it was sold to fellow producer Edward Germano, who turned it into a 100,000 square foot studio with seven recording rooms and live mastering suites. His first client was Stevie Wonder, who recorded part of his classic album Songs In The Key Of Life there. Other well-known albums to be recorded or partially recorded at the studio include Bruce Springsteen's Born In The USA, the Rolling Stones' Emotional Rescue and Paul Simon's Graceland. Michael Jackson, Billy Joel, Jay-Z and Beyonce are also among artists who have used the Hit Factory in the past, as well as 50 Cent who survived an attempt on his life as he left the premises in 2000.

US rappers Beastie Boys have won their long-running battle over the use of a sample in their song Pass the Mic.

The punk-rappers used three notes of music from flautist James Newton's Choir in their track from 1992. Although the group had paid a licence fee for the sample, Mr Newton said his copyright had been infringed. But the US Court of Appeal upheld its original decision that the group did not have to pay an additional fee to license the underlying composition. The Beastie Boys - Michael Diamond, Adam Horowitz, and Adam Yauch - are considered to be one of early pioneers of sampling music.

Sampling, now a standard practice among musicians, involves taking a segment of one track and using it in a different song. A three-judge panel of the court held in 2003 that the band had abided by copyright protections by paying a licence fee for a sample of Mr Newton's recording. That finding upheld a lower-court dismissal of the case in favour of the Beastie Boys. ""We hold that Beastie Boys' use of a brief segment of that composition, consisting of three notes separated by a half-step over a background C note, is not sufficient to sustain a claim for infringement of Newton's copyright,"" Chief Judge Mary Schroeder wrote in her opinion. Mr Newton is a critically acclaimed jazz and classical flutist, composer, performer, and university professor. Mr Newton and the Beastie Boys were not available for comment.",gpt-3.5,"Alright, boys and girls, I have a very interesting story to share with you today! Imagine a group of friends who love to make music together called the Beastie Boys. They made a special song called ""Pass the Mic"" a long time ago.

Now, James Newton felt that the Beastie Boys used his music without asking him properly, even though the Beastie Boys had paid a small fee to use it. He thought they should pay more money for using his music. But a group of very wise judges listened to both sides and decided that the Beastie Boys did not have to pay any extra money to James Newton.

You see, what the Beastie Boys did is something many musicians do called sampling. It's like when you take a little piece of someone else's drawing and use it in your own artwork. The judges said that the part the Beastie Boys used from James Newton's music was so small and different that it was okay for them to use it.

Now, the Beastie Boys are known as pioneers because they were one of the first to use sampling in their music. They were very happy when the judges said they did nothing wrong. James Newton is a very talented musician who plays beautiful music with his flute.

Remember, boys and girls, it's important to ask permission if you want to use someone else's things, just like the Beastie Boys did. And it's also important to share and be fair, just like the judges helped the Beastie Boys and James Newton find a fair solution."

So, to make these special burgers, we need to mix some special ingredients like turkey (which is like a special kind of meat), onion (which is like a vegetable that makes us cry when we cut it), chili powder (which is like a magical spice that makes the food taste delicious), lime zest (which is like a special part of a lime that adds a yummy flavor), and cilantro (which is like a green leaf that smells so good).

We mix all these ingredients together with some salt and pepper, just like mixing colors to make a beautiful painting. Then, we shape the mixture into little patties, like making small, round sandcastles. We make a little dent in the middle of each patty to help them cook evenly, like making a little nest for a baby bird.

Next, we make a special sauce called guacamole by mashing avocado (which is like a creamy, green fruit) with tomato (which is like a red fruit that tastes juicy), more cilantro, lime juice (which is like a sour liquid that comes from a special fruit), and a little more salt. It's like making a colorful and tasty rainbow!

After that, we cook the turkey patties on a hot grill, just like cooking pancakes on a big metal pan. We wait for the patties to get grilled marks and flip them over gently, like flipping a pancake without squishing it. We add some cheese on top of the patties to make them extra yummy, like sprinkling sprinkles on top of ice cream.

Finally, we put the cooked patties on buns, like putting a hat on a doll. We add the guacamole on top of the patties, like adding a colorful scarf, and cover them with the bun tops. And there you have it, our special Guacamole Turkey Burgers are ready to be eaten and enjoyed like a magical feast!

So, my little friends, making Guacamole Turkey Burgers is like creating a special food adventure in our magical kitchen. Let's imagine making these delicious burgers together and have fun exploring new flavors and textures!"

historical_7.txt,https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jensenbaxter/10dataset-text-document-classification?resource=download,"After an asteroid crashed into what is now Chicxulub, Mexico 66 million years ago, a chain of events occurred that caused dinosaurs to disappear and mammals to flourish. But figuring out exactly what happened after this event, known as the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction event, has been tricky due to a sparse fossil record. Yesterday (October 24), a team of researchers published a paper in Science detailing their 2016 discovery of a trove of plant and mammal fossils that sheds light on how ecosystems recovered after the asteroid impact.

The researchers, led by vertebrate paleontologist Tyler Lyson at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, have found over 1,000 vertebrate fossils, including 16 mammal species at the Corral Bluffs fossil site, located near Colorado Springs. They also found over 6,000 leaf fossils and 37,000 pollen grains, reports The New York Times.

""With this discovery, we're starting to see the entire skull of many of these mammals that we previously only knew from teeth,"" Stephen Chester, a mammalian paleontologist at Brooklyn College and paper coauthor, told the Times.

The site shows a near-continuous record of plant and animal life over a period of one million years following the K-Pg mass extinction, according to Science. Lyson and his team were able to determine the age of the site through volcanic ash layers with radioactive minerals, along with the presence of many fern fossils, which thrive after an ecosystem has been disturbed.

The researchers found that plants and animals rebounded faster than previously thought, and that when ferns were replaced by palm forests, the variety of plants also sparked diversification of mammals from small rat-sized animals to larger ones. By 700,000 years after the extinction event, some mammals were 100 times bigger than ones that had lived through the asteroid impact.

""This is one of those discoveries all paleontologists dream of,"" Steve Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the research, tells Science News.",gpt-3.5,"Alright, boys and girls, let me tell you an exciting story about a time long, long ago when dinosaurs roamed the Earth. One day, a big space rock called an asteroid crashed into the Earth in a place called Chicxulub, Mexico. This crash was so powerful that it made the dinosaurs disappear. But do you know what happened next? Let me tell you!

After the dinosaurs were gone, a special team of scientists went on an adventure to find out more about what happened. They discovered a treasure trove of fossils - like puzzle pieces from the past - that helped them learn about how plants and animals changed after the asteroid crash.

They found lots of bones and teeth from different animals, and even tiny grains that are like plant seeds. With these discoveries, the scientists were able to see how plants and animals grew and changed over a million years after the asteroid crash.

One scientist, Tyler, found out that after the crash, small animals started to become bigger and more diverse. It's like if you have a tiny toy and then it grows into a big toy! The scientists also found out that when certain plants started growing again, new kinds of animals appeared too. It's like when you plant a seed and watch it grow into a beautiful flower.

It was a very exciting discovery for the scientists, just like finding a hidden treasure! Another scientist, Steve, said it was a dream come true for them to learn so much about the past. Isn't that amazing?

So, boys and girls, this story teaches us that even when something big and scary happens, like the asteroid crash, life finds a way to keep going and changing. Just like how you learn and grow every day in our classroom!"

During the Spanish-American War, rebels in the Philippines proclaimed their independence after 300 years of Spanish rule... only to have their hopes for a free nation written off with a few pen strokes when the Treaty of Paris was signed in 1898, handing the Philippines to the United States. Rebel leader Emilio Aguinaldo-who had convened a revolutionary assembly that drew up the first democratic constitution in Asia-launched a revolt. 

The United States responded by sending in troops and by war's end, over 4,000 American soldiers had died, ten times the number of Americans killed in the Spanish-American War. Losses among locals were worse: 20,000 Filipino insurgents and an unknown number of civilians lost their lives in the fight for independence.

David Silbey, associate director, Cornell in Washington and author of A War of Frontier and Empire: The Philippine-American War, 1899-1902, writes that the Philippine-American War ""was our last war of manifest destiny and western expansion and our first imperial land war in Asia. It was the United States testing out what role it would have on the world stage and bringing with it all the complicated racial and cultural attitudes that shaped American society at home.""",gpt-3.5,"Alright, my dear students, let me tell you a story about a faraway land called the Philippines. A long time ago, the people of the Philippines wanted to be free and make their own rules after being told what to do by others for many years. They were so excited to have their own country!

But, one day, a big paper was signed by important people from far away, and suddenly the Philippines belonged to another country called the United States. The people of the Philippines were sad and angry because they wanted to be independent and free.

The leader of the Filipino people, Emilio Aguinaldo, said, ""No way! We want to be free!"" So, there was a big fight between the United States and the people of the Philippines. Many soldiers from both sides got hurt, and sadly, many people lost their lives.

A wise man named David Silbey said that this war was important because it was the United States trying to figure out how to be a good friend to other countries. They had to learn how to treat people from different places with respect and kindness.

So, my dear students, this story teaches us that it's important to be fair and kind to everyone, no matter where they come from. We should always try to understand and help each other, just like friends do."

At the outbreak of fighting in 1914, the United States remained on the sidelines of World War I, adopting the policy of neutrality favored by President Woodrow Wilson while continuing to engage in commerce and shipping with European countries on both sides of the conflict.

Neutrality, however, was increasing difficult to maintain in the face of Germany's unchecked submarine aggression against neutral ships, including those carrying passengers. In 1915, Germany declared the waters surrounding the British Isles to be a war zone, and German U-boats sunk several commercial and passenger vessels, including some U.S. ships.

Widespread protest over the sinking by U-boat of the British ocean liner Lusitania-traveling from New York to Liverpool, England with hundreds of American passengers onboard-in May 1915 helped turn the tide of American public opinion against Germany. In February 1917, Congress passed a $250 million arms appropriations bill intended to make the United States ready for war.

Germany sunk four more U.S. merchant ships the following month, and on April 2 Woodrow Wilson appeared before Congress and called for a declaration of war against Germany.",gpt-3.5,"Alright, my little friends, I have a very interesting story to tell you today. Let's imagine that we are all living in a big world with many different countries. One day, some countries started fighting with each other in a big war. But the United States, where we live, decided to stay out of the fight and not get involved. This is like when you see two friends arguing on the playground, but you choose to stay neutral and not take sides.

However, things started to change because one country, called Germany, was being very mean and attacking ships that were not even part of the fight. They were like pirates in the sea, sinking ships that were carrying people and things between different countries. One day, they even sank a big ship called the Lusitania, which had many American friends on board. This made a lot of people in the United States very upset with Germany.

So, our leader, President Woodrow Wilson, talked to the other leaders in our country and they decided that it was time to stand up against Germany. They wanted to make sure that our country was prepared in case we needed to join the big war. And finally, in April 1917, our President went to talk to a group of important people called Congress and asked them to officially declare that the United States was going to help stop Germany's bad actions.

And that, my dear children, is how the United States entered the big war to help make the world a safer and happier place for everyone."

British hurdler Sarah Claxton is confident she can win her first major medal at next month's European Indoor Championships in Madrid.

The 25-year-old has already smashed the British record over 60m hurdles twice this season, setting a new mark of 7.96 seconds to win the AAAs title. ""I am quite confident,"" said Claxton. ""But I take each race as it comes. ""As long as I keep up my training but not do too much I think there is a chance of a medal."" Claxton has won the national 60m hurdles title for the past three years but has struggled to translate her domestic success to the international stage. Now, the Scotland-born athlete owns the equal fifth-fastest time in the world this year. And at last week's Birmingham Grand Prix, Claxton left European medal favourite Russian Irina Shevchenko trailing in sixth spot.

For the first time, Claxton has only been preparing for a campaign over the hurdles - which could explain her leap in form.

Just like how you practice coloring inside the lines or building tall towers with your blocks, Sarah has been practicing jumping over hurdles. She has even broken a special record in her country by running very fast over the hurdles!

Even though Sarah has won many races in her country before, she has never won a big shiny medal in an international race. But this time, she believes she can do it! At a recent race in Birmingham, she competed against a very strong opponent from Russia, and she was faster than her!

Now, Sarah has decided to focus only on jumping over hurdles, instead of doing other sports like long jump. It's like how you might decide to play with your favorite toy all day instead of trying different toys. She hopes that this new way of training will help her win a medal at the European Indoor Championships.

Maurice Greene aims to wipe out the pain of losing his Olympic 100m title in Athens by winning a fourth World Championship crown this summer.

He had to settle for bronze in Greece behind fellow American Justin Gatlin and Francis Obikwelu of Portugal. ""It really hurts to look at that medal. It was my mistake. I lost because of the things I did,"" said Greene, who races in Birmingham on Friday. ""It's never going to happen again. My goal - I'm going to win the worlds."" Greene crossed the line just 0.02 seconds behind Gatlin, who won in 9.87 seconds in one of the closest and fastest sprints of all time. But Greene believes he lost the race and his title in the semi-finals. ""In my semi-final race, I should have won the race but I was conserving energy. ""That's when Francis Obikwelu came up and I took third because I didn't know he was there. ""I believe that's what put me in lane seven in the final and, while I was in lane seven, I couldn't feel anything in the race.

""I just felt like I was running all alone. ""I believe if I was in the middle of the race I would have been able to react to people that came ahead of me.""

The pair contest the 60m, the distance over which Greene currently holds the world record of 6.39 seconds. He then has another indoor meeting in France before resuming training for the outdoor season and the task of recapturing his world title in Helsinki in August.

But Maurice didn't give up. He said he was going to try again and win another important race called the World Championship. He felt like he lost the race in Athens because he didn't run as fast as he could in the earlier race. Maurice believes that if he had run faster in the first race, he would have done better in the final race.

Maurice is now getting ready for another race in Birmingham, and he wants to win this one to show that he is still a very good runner. He will have to race against other fast runners, but he is determined to do his best and try to win the world title in another race that will happen in a place called Helsinki.

Maurice knows that there are other fast runners like him who want to win too, but he is not afraid of them. He is focused on training hard and running as fast as he can to achieve his goal.

Greek athletics' governing body has postponed by two weeks the judgement on sprinters Costas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou for missing doping tests.

The pair are facing lengthy bans for the missed tests, including one on the eve of last year's Athens Olympics. They were set to learn their fate by the end of February, but late evidence from them has pushed the date back. ""A decision is now expected by around mid-March,"" said one of their lawyers, Michalis Dimitrakopoulos. Kenteris, 31, who won the men's 200m title at the 2000 Sydney Games and Thanou, 30, who won the women's 100m silver medal in Sydney, face a maximum two-year ban if found guilty. The athletes, who spectacularly withdrew from the Athens Olympics, have been suspended by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) for missing the three tests. The IAAF said the sprinters had failed to provide samples for tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and ordered Greek athletic's governing body, Segas, to hold a disciplinary inquiry. The athletes also face a criminal hearing in Greece over the missed drugs tests and have been charged with faking a motorcycle accident on the day of the Athens test, which led to them spending four days in hospital. Following the final hearing in late January, the athletes sounded confident they would be acquitted. ""I am confident and optimistic,"" Thanou had said at the time.

Chinese authorities closed 12,575 net cafes in the closing months of 2004, the country's government said.

According to the official news agency most of the net cafes were closed down because they were operating illegally. Chinese net cafes operate under a set of strict guidelines and many of those most recently closed broke rules that limit how close they can be to schools. The move is the latest in a series of steps the Chinese government has taken to crack down on what it considers to be immoral net use.

The official Xinhua News Agency said the crackdown was carried out to create a ""safer environment for young people in China"". Rules introduced in 2002 demand that net cafes be at least 200 metres away from middle and elementary schools. The hours that children can use net cafes are also tightly regulated. China has long been worried that net cafes are an unhealthy influence on young people. The 12,575 cafes were shut in the three months from October to December. China also tries to dictate the types of computer games people can play to limit the amount of violence people are exposed to.

Net cafes are hugely popular in China because the relatively high cost of computer hardware means that few people have PCs in their homes. This is not the first time that the Chinese government has moved against net cafes that are not operating within its strict guidelines. All the 100,000 or so net cafes in the country are required to use software that controls what websites users can see. Logs of sites people visit are also kept. Laws on net cafe opening hours and who can use them were introduced in 2002 following a fire at one cafe that killed 25 people. During the crackdown following the blaze authorities moved to clean up net cafes and demanded that all of them get permits to operate. In August 2004 Chinese authorities shut down 700 websites and arrested 224 people in a crackdown on net porn. At the same time it introduced new controls to block overseas sex sites.

They closed down many net cafes that were not following the rules, especially those that were too close to schools. The government wanted to create a safer environment for the young children in the country, just like how we want to keep our classroom safe for all of you.

In this country, net cafes are very popular because not everyone has a computer at home. The government also wanted to make sure that children were not exposed to bad things like violent games. They introduced rules to control what games people could play in the net cafes.

The government also made sure that all net cafes had special software to control what websites people could visit. They kept a record of the websites visited by people, just like how we keep track of our toys in the classroom.

Overall, the government wanted to make sure that everyone was safe and following the rules when using the computers in the net cafes. They even shut down some websites that were showing bad things and made sure that people were not using the internet in a bad way.

Microsoft has warned PC users to update their systems with the latest security fixes for flaws in Windows programs.

In its monthly security bulletin, it flagged up eight ""critical"" security holes which could leave PCs open to attack if left unpatched. The number of holes considered ""critical"" is more than usual. They affect Windows programs, including Internet Explorer (IE), media player and instant messaging. Four other important fixes were also released. These were considered to be less critical, however. If not updated, either automatically or manually, PC users running the programs could be vulnerable to viruses or other malicious attacks designed to exploit the holes. Many of the flaws could be used by virus writers to take over computers remotely, install programs, change, and delete or see data.

One of the critical patches Microsoft has made available is an important one that fixes some IE flaws. Stephen Toulouse, a Microsoft security manager, said the flaws were known about, and although the firm had not seen any attacks exploiting the flaw, he did not rule them out. Often, when a critical flaw is announced, spates of viruses follow because home users and businesses leave the flaw unpatched. A further patch fixes a hole in Media Player, Windows Messenger and MSN Messenger which an attacker could use to take control of unprotected machines through .png files. Microsoft announces any vulnerabilities in its software every month. The most important ones are those which are classed as ""critical"".

They even said that some of the holes could let bad bugs take control of our computers and do naughty things like changing our toys or looking at our pictures!

One of the special patches is for a program called Internet Explorer, which is like a magical door that helps us explore the internet world. Another one is for a music and chatting program that lets us listen to music and talk to friends. These patches are like special shields that protect these programs from any bugs trying to sneak in.

Microsoft is like a superhero that tells us every month about any holes in their programs and gives us these special patches to keep our computer toys safe. They want to make sure that all the families and businesses using their programs are safe from any bad bugs.
