doc0001,https://science.nasa.gov/mission/lucy/,"Lucy is the first space mission to explore a diverse population of small bodies known as the Jupiter Trojan asteroids. These remnants of our early solar system are trapped on stable orbits associated with - but not close to - the giant planet Jupiter. Trojan asteroids orbit in two ""swarms"" that lead and follow Jupiter in its orbit around the Sun and are thought to be comparable in number to the objects in the main asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.

Over its 12-year mission, Lucy will explore a record-breaking number of asteroids: it will fly by two (plus a newly discovered satellite) in the belt of asteroids that circle the Sun between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, and then eight Trojans, which includes five asteroid targets and the satellites of three of those. Lucy also will fly by Earth three times to get a push from its gravity, making it the first spacecraft to return to the vicinity of Earth from the outer solar system.",gpt-3.5,dt03,"1. Lucy is a space mission going to explore Jupiter Trojan asteroids.
2. Jupiter Trojan asteroids are old rocks from our early solar system.
3. These asteroids are in stable orbits near Jupiter but not too close.
4. There are two groups of Trojan asteroids that follow and lead Jupiter.
5. The Trojan asteroids are almost as many as the ones in the main asteroid belt.
6. Lucy's mission will last for 12 years.
7. Lucy will visit a high number of asteroids, including two in the asteroid belt and eight Trojans.
8. Among the Trojans, there are five asteroids and three satellites.
9. Lucy will also pass by Earth three times to use its gravity for a speed boost.
10. This makes Lucy the first spacecraft to come back near Earth from outer space.
11. Lucy will study the asteroids to learn more about our solar system's history.
12. The mission aims to discover new information about these distant asteroids."
