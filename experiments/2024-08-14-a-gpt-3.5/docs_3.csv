doc0001,https://science.nasa.gov/mission/lucy/,"Lucy is the first space mission to explore a diverse population of small bodies known as the Jupiter Trojan asteroids. These remnants of our early solar system are trapped on stable orbits associated with - but not close to - the giant planet Jupiter. Trojan asteroids orbit in two ""swarms"" that lead and follow Jupiter in its orbit around the Sun and are thought to be comparable in number to the objects in the main asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.

Over its 12-year mission, Lucy will explore a record-breaking number of asteroids: it will fly by two (plus a newly discovered satellite) in the belt of asteroids that circle the Sun between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, and then eight Trojans, which includes five asteroid targets and the satellites of three of those. Lucy also will fly by Earth three times to get a push from its gravity, making it the first spacecraft to return to the vicinity of Earth from the outer solar system.",gpt-3.5,dt03,"1.

NASA is gearing up for an exciting mission with the upcoming launch of Lucy, a spacecraft designed to study the Trojan asteroids, remnants from the early solar system. Scheduled for liftoff in October 2021, Lucy will embark on a journey of over 500 million miles to investigate these asteroids located in Jupiter's orbit.

Named after the famous fossilized hominid, Lucy will utilize Earth's gravity to propel itself towards the Greek and Trojan camps, two distinct groups of asteroids. Among the targets for Lucy's exploration are the asteroids Donaldjohanson and Kowal, located in the asteroid belt.

Over the course of the expected 12-year mission, Lucy will conduct in-depth studies of the geology, surface composition, and history of the Trojan asteroids. This mission marks a significant step in unraveling the mysteries of our solar system's early days and promises groundbreaking discoveries in the field of planetary science."
