doc0001,https://science.nasa.gov/mission/lucy/,"Lucy is the first space mission to explore a diverse population of small bodies known as the Jupiter Trojan asteroids. These remnants of our early solar system are trapped on stable orbits associated with - but not close to - the giant planet Jupiter. Trojan asteroids orbit in two ""swarms"" that lead and follow Jupiter in its orbit around the Sun and are thought to be comparable in number to the objects in the main asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.

Over its 12-year mission, Lucy will explore a record-breaking number of asteroids: it will fly by two (plus a newly discovered satellite) in the belt of asteroids that circle the Sun between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, and then eight Trojans, which includes five asteroid targets and the satellites of three of those. Lucy also will fly by Earth three times to get a push from its gravity, making it the first spacecraft to return to the vicinity of Earth from the outer solar system.",gpt-3.5,"Once upon a time, there was a special spaceship named Lucy. Lucy had a very important mission - she was going to visit some special rocks that were very far away in space. These rocks are like a big family, and they live near a huge planet called Jupiter. 

Jupiter is like the big brother in the family, and these rocks are his friends who follow him as he moves around the Sun. Lucy was going to visit these rocks one by one to learn more about them. She was going to fly by some rocks that circle the Sun near Mars and Jupiter, and then visit even more rocks that are friends of Jupiter.

But Lucy was very smart - she knew she needed a little help from Earth to travel so far. So, she flew by Earth three times to get a little push from Earth's gravity. Lucy was very brave as she traveled so far from home, and she was going to be the first spaceship to come back to Earth from so far away in space.

So, Lucy's adventure is all about exploring and learning about these special rocks and showing us how amazing and big our solar system is. Just like how we learn new things every day, Lucy is also on a big learning adventure in space."

Arnold Schwarzenegger was born in Thal, Austria, a small village bordering the Styrian capital of Graz. He immigrated to the United States in 1968 and became a U.S. citizen in 1983.

Schwarzenegger earned a BA in Business and International Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Superior. He received an honorary Doctorate from the University of Wisconsin-Superior in 1996 and an honorary Doctorate from Chapman University in 2002.
    
An increasingly politically active Republican during the 1990s, Schwarzenegger ran for the California governorship and won when Gray Davis was recalled in 2003. Schwarzenegger was sworn in as the 38th Governor of California on November 17, 2003, following careers in body building, business and entertainment. Schwarzenegger was the first foreign-born governor of California since Irish-born Governor John G. Downey (Governor of California from 1860 to 1862). While governor, Schwarzenegger focused on reducing California's greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the minimum wage, and updating the workers' compensation system. He was also a proponent of physical education and after-school programs, and supported the After-School Education & Safety Act, which passed in 2002.",gpt-3.5,"Once upon a time, there was a man named Arnold. He was born in a faraway place called Thal, in a small village near a big city. Arnold moved to a magical land called the United States when he was a young man. He worked very hard and studied at a special school where he learned about business and economics.

After many years, Arnold decided to help make important decisions for a sunny place called California. He became the leader, like a superhero, and was known as the Governor. Arnold cared a lot about the environment and wanted to keep the air clean for everyone. He also wanted kids to have fun and play after school, so he made sure they had programs to learn and play together.

Arnold was a special governor because he came from a different country, just like a fairy tale where someone from a different land becomes a hero. He did many good things to help people and make California a better place for everyone. And that, my little friends, is the story of Arnold Schwarzenegger, the governor who worked hard to make the world a better place. The end."
