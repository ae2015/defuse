Justin Jefferson and CeeDee Lamb each received positive prognosis about their injury issues, which is something that can't be said for the rest of the stars across the NFL. Christian McCaffrey is already on injured reserve, Deebo Samuel is out for a weeks and a slew of other running backs and wide receivers are dealing with ailments that could keep them out of Week 3. Below is a look at all of the significant injuries that could affect fantasy football matchups across Week 3. Justin Jefferson Off Injury Report",
            "Justin Jefferson was taken off the Minnesota Vikings injury report on Friday. Jefferson's status was up in the air because of a quad injury, but he practiced well enough this week that the injury is not a concern. The superstar wide out will be needed for Minnesota's home clash with the Houston Texans, which has the potential to be a high-scoring affair. Jefferson is always the primary target in Minnesota when healthy, but he should have more targets in Week 3 because Jordan Addison and T.J. Hockenson are still out. Jefferson earned seven targets from Sam Darnold in Week 2. Only running back Aaron Jones had more than four targets against the New York Giants. Houston's defense may give Jefferson some fits, led by cornerback Derek Stingley Jr. but it has allowed 330 receiving yards to opposing wide outs on just 20 catches through two weeks. Jefferson is an automatic start whenever he's healthy, and his star power may be needed more on certain fantasy rosters in Week 3 depending on how many injuries affect a single roster."

            "Two of the best wide receivers in the NFL are expected to be on the field for their respective Week 3 games. Justin Jefferson and CeeDee Lamb each received positive prognosis about their injury issues, which is something that can't be said for the rest of the stars across the NFL. Christian McCaffrey is already on injured reserve, Deebo Samuel is out for a weeks and a slew of other running backs and wide receivers are dealing with ailments that could keep them out of Week 3. Below is a look at all of the significant injuries that could affect fantasy football matchups across Week 3. Justin Jefferson Off Injury Report",
            "Justin Jefferson was taken off the Minnesota Vikings injury report on Friday. Jefferson's status was up in the air because of a quad injury, but he practiced well enough this week that the injury is not a concern. The superstar wide out will be needed for Minnesota's home clash with the Houston Texans, which has the potential to be a high-scoring affair. Jefferson is always the primary target in Minnesota when healthy, but he should have more targets in Week 3 because Jordan Addison and T.J. Hockenson are still out. Jefferson earned seven targets from Sam Darnold in Week 2. Only running back Aaron Jones had more than four targets against the New York Giants. Houston's defense may give Jefferson some fits, led by cornerback Derek Stingley Jr. but it has allowed 330 receiving yards to opposing wide outs on just 20 catches through two weeks. Jefferson is an automatic start whenever he's healthy, and his star power may be needed more on certain fantasy rosters in Week 3 depending on how many injuries affect a single roster."

The document states, 'Justin Jefferson was taken off the Minnesota Vikings injury report on Friday…the injury is not a concern.'

The document mentions, 'Jefferson is always the primary target in Minnesota when healthy, but he should have more targets in Week 3 because Jordan Addison and T.J. Hockenson are still out.'
